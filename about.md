Iâ€™m currently working as a postdoctoral researcher on themes related (but not limited) to clustering, pattern recognition, and multi-view learning.

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics from  Chung Yuan Christian University, under the guidance of [Prof. Miin-Shen Yang](https://msyang3.wixsite.com/msyang/english).
